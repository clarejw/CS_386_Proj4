What is the fucntionality of kernel.asm here?


- go code is just emulating what an actual CPU would be doing
    - state of the cpu
    - behaviors it needs to enforce


for instructions restrictions
    - is this assembly stuff or the cpu struct stuff supposed to handle this?

what does the trapaddress do? how do we increment?
